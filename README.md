# Track My Playtime

A simple program that is ready to help you to always know your game playtime

## ⭐ Featured
- Gameplay Time Tracker
- Discord Rich Presence
- Makes it easier for you when you want to choose a vn game from your collection
- Screenshot _(not all games can be supported)_

### 📖 Intended for Visual Novel games
If you like playing visual novel games, then you should try using this program, because you can find out how much time it takes to complete the vn game you are going to play.


> If you play vn games in Japanese or other languages, I have also added the auto [Textractor](https://github.com/Artikash/Textractor) launch feature when you run your game, so the [Textractor](https://github.com/Artikash/Textractor) will automatically run at the same time when you start the game you are going to play. <br>
> Of course you have to have the program first
